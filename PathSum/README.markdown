#Path sum

###Problem
Given a binary tree and a sum, determine if the tree has a root-to-leaf path such that adding up all the values along the path equals the given sum. 

###Solution
The solution employs backtracking algorithm. The sum of a tree is the sum of the value in root node and sum of either sub-tree.
